## ✅ Steps Completed  

### **1️⃣ Implemented Feature to See All Connections**  
- Designed a **Connections Page** to display all accepted connections.  
- Created a structured layout for showing **profile pictures, names, and interaction buttons**.  

### **2️⃣ API to Get Connections**  
- Integrated an **API call to fetch all accepted connections** from the backend.  
- Ensured only authenticated users can access this data.  

### **3️⃣ Created Redux Store for Connections (`connectionSlice`)**  
- Defined a **Redux slice (`connectionSlice`)** to store and manage the user’s connections.  
- Updated Redux state when new connections are fetched.  
- Ensured state updates dynamically across components.  

### **4️⃣ Displaying Connections List in UI**  
- Retrieved connection data from **Redux store** and displayed it in a structured format.  
- Used **Tailwind CSS & Daisy UI** to style the connection cards.  

### **5️⃣ Implemented Feature to Show All Connection Requests**  
- Added a **Request Page** where users can view pending connection requests.  
- Displayed sender details (name, profile picture) along with action buttons.  

### **6️⃣ Fetching & Storing Connection Requests**  
- Called **API to fetch pending connection requests**.  
- Stored request data in **Redux store** for efficient state management.  
- Ensured UI updates dynamically as requests are received or processed.  

### **7️⃣ Accept & Reject Connection Requests**  
- Implemented functionality to **accept or reject** incoming connection requests.  
- Upon user action:  
  - **Accepted requests** move to the **Connections Page**.  
  - **Rejected requests** are removed from the UI.  
- Updated **Redux store** after each action to ensure UI reflects changes immediately.
